Cipher
A cipher is an algorithm used to perform encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. Ciphers are used to encrypt information, making it unreadable to anyone who does not have the appropriate key to decrypt it.
Decipher
Deciphering is the process of converting encrypted data (ciphertext) back into its original form (plaintext). This involves using a key or algorithm to reverse the encryption process. Successful deciphering allows the original message to be read by someone with the correct key.
